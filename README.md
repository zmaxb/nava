# NAVA

ðŸ’¡ **What is NAVA?**  
NAVA is a declarative wrapper for browser automation based on Playwright.

It lets you quickly create flexible scripts in a simple and clear JSON-based `.nava` format, without the need to write code. For most tasks, a declarative description is enough, but you can also add JavaScript snippets to extend functionality and perform advanced operations when needed.
